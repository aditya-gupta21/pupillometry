2. segmentationAD.ipynb - classical AD cohort technique experimentation & misc processing
3. segmentationHC.ipynb - classical HC cohort technique experimentation & misc processing
4. analysis.ipynb - generation of results plots
5. dir RITnet - RITnet implementation, code adapted from https://github.com/AayushKrChaudhary/RITnet.

The RITnet directory contains code from Choudhary et al.'s RITnet implementation (the original authors). Only the required files are contained, however the full RITnet code can be found on https://github.com/AayushKrChaudhary/RITnet.
